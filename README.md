# Capstone_Rating_Prediction_Model
Built a rating prediction model to help a hospital improve its services

## Business Problem Statement
The Centres for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), a federal agency based in the US, is responsible for administering the country’s major healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. CMS collects, analyses the data and produces research reports. It then works to eliminate the instances of fraud and abuse within the healthcare system. The agency aims to provide a healthcare system with better care, access to coverage and improved health services to the citizens. CMS also aims to reduce the overall health costs such as hospital expenses and insurance premiums for the citizens.</br>
The CMS rates hospitals in the US on a scale of 1-5, with the objective of making it easier for patients and consumers to compare the quality of services offered by various hospitals.</br>
The ratings directly influence the consumers’ choice of hospitals and may significantly impact hospitals' revenues. Thus, it is extremely important for hospitals to identify the key factors that affect their ratings so that they can work on improving them.</br>
Evanston Hospital is a comprehensive acute-care facility in Illinois, US. The hospital offers a wide range of services and surgical specialities, in addition to having high-end lab capabilities. Despite spending a considerable amount of resources on improving its services, the hospital’s CMS rating has remained at 3 for the past 5 years, and this has led to a steady decline in revenue for the hospital. For hospitals like Evanston, these ratings directly influence the choice made by consumers who are looking for a healthcare provider and would, therefore, have a significant impact on the hospitals’ revenues.

## Business Objective:
As a consulting company hired by Evanston, our task is to identify possible root causes for the hospital getting such an average rating and recommend measures to mitigate this problem.

## Solution Methodology
* Used the concepts of structured problem-solving to identify potential root causes for the issues faced by Evanston Hospital
* Built a rating prediction model of past hospital data as a proof of concept
* Steps:
  * Understanding the data, cleaning it and preparing it for further analysis
  * Performing univariate/bivariate analysis and feature engineering
  * Training different machine learning models on the data
  * Choosing and evaluating the model that provides the best metrics
  * Data storytelling using the insights and modelling results, and proposing a business solution
